description: Show active changes with conflicts, progress, and dependencies
---

Show status of all active changes.

Lists changes in `specs/.delta/`, showing:
- Which artifacts exist (proposal, design, specs)
- Dependencies status and dependency graph
- Conflict detection (overlapping requirement modifications)
- Task progress (if tasks were created)
- Recommended next steps

Use the status skill to execute this workflow.
