# Version Check

Check `specs/.delta-spec.json` for version compatibility:
- If file missing → tell user to run `/ds:init` first
- If version matches current plugin version → proceed
- If version mismatch → warn user and offer to migrate:
  > "This project uses delta-spec v{old}. Current version is v{new}."
  > Options:
  > - **Migrate** - Update to current version (may modify spec format)
  > - **Continue anyway** - Use current commands without migrating
  > - **Cancel** - Stop and review changes first
